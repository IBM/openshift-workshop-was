# Workshop Lab Setup

This section contains instructions to access Openshift Clusters for those workshops that use IBM public cloud

## Prequisite

You will be given a URL specific to your workshop (e.g. `https://<workshop name>.mybluemix.net/`), and a lab key for the cluster assignment through email before the workshop session. 
 
## Browser Requirement

- Please use Firefox or Chrome when possible during the workshop. It's been noted IE or Edge browser may cause an unexpected behavior accessing the URLs for the lab.
- When accessing Open Shift Web Console through IBM Cloud login, you may experience the block pop-up from the browser, please ensure to unblock in order to proceed. 
  - Also note other type of blocks may be caused by your company's firewall rules, please check if any alternative can be used.

## Signing up with a new or existing IBMid

You can sign up for an IBM Cloud account by using your existing IBMid or by creating a new IBMid.
To sign up for IBM Cloud with an IBMid:
- Go to the [IBM Cloud login page](https://cloud.ibm.com), and click **Create an account**.
- Enter your IBMid email address. If you don't have an existing IBMid, an ID is created based on the email that you enter.
- Complete the remaining fields with your information, and click **Create account**.
- Confirm your account by clicking the link in the confirmation email that's sent to your provided email address.
- **Note**: If your IBMid is not with email pattern (e.g., a shortname), please inform the workshop presenter then a manual cluster assignment will be made accordinly. In the next step ##Cluser Assignment, you will start by logging in [IBM Cloud login page](https://cloud.ibm.com) and continue with the step "- Once logged in, ensure that the account selected is **2044184 - CP4AWorkshops**".

Note: You may optionally deactivate your account after the lab. 
However, we encourage you to keep your account for future labs. 
After deactivation, you will need to contact IBM Support to reactivate it. 
If you insist on deactivation, follow the instructions on the support page for "lite account": https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/how-can-you-cancel-your-ibm-cloud-account.

This is the ALL view, it includes all of the Dojo Toolkit packages.  

This currently consists of:
	dojo/ (the core) 
	dijit/ (the Dojo widget system)
	dojox/ (additional Dojo-based components)
	demos/ (the demos for use on dojotoolkit.org)
	utils/ (the build system, doc system, and additional resources)

When viewing this tree from http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/src/view/anon/all/trunk you
will not see any of the available files. Each project above is using an svn:external
pointing to it's trunk folder. 

For instance, Dojo Core repository is: 
http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/src/dojo/trunk 

There are two versions of this view: anonymous and committer. 

For users (readonly):

For committers (read/write):
https://svn.dojotoolkit.org/src/view/committer/all/trunk
